# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## About the Repository
This repository contains practical exercises and projects completed as part
of the CP1404 Programming II subject at James Cook University. These practicals 
are designed to develop skills in clean code practices, programming patterns, 
and software development principles in the programming language python.

## About Me
Hello! I'm Leah Feltham, a first year Information Technology bachelor student
at James Cook University.

## Lessons Learned in Clean Code
- **Consistency is Key:** Consistent naming conventions, formatting, and code 
structure make it easier for others to read and understand my code.
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each function, method, and class should 
have a single purpose, making the code efficient and easier to maintain.
- **Clear Documentation:** Including clear comments, docstrings, and a README
file helps others and future me to understand the purpose and 
usage of the code.
