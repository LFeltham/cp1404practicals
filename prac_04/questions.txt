Logic Exercise:
Only one marble needs to be pulled. Pull one marble from the box labelled "mixed"- whatever colour that
one marble is what colour the box actually is, and therefore the box labelled the colour that wasn't in the
"mixed" box must be the actual mixed marbles. The third box is then whichever colour was found in
the box labelled "mixed". If "mixed" has one white, the "mixed" box is white, the box labelled "black"
must have the mixed marbles as it cannot be white or black, and the "white" bow will have the black marbles.
